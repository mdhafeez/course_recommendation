This Flask application is designed to provide course recommendations based on a user's job role and previous ratings. It combines content-based filtering and collaborative filtering methods to generate recommendations. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

 1. Initialization and Data Loading

- Imports: The script imports necessary libraries including Flask for web development, pandas for data manipulation, and scikit-learn for machine learning.

- Data Loading: It loads course and rating data from CSV files:
  - `courses_df` contains details about courses.
  - `ratings_df` contains user ratings for courses. If the ratings file doesn't exist, an empty DataFrame is created.

 2. Recommendation Functions

- Content-Based Filtering (`content_based_recommendations`):
  - This function recommends courses based on the skills and sub-skills required for a specific job role.
  - It uses TF-IDF vectorization to convert course skills and sub-skills into numerical vectors.
  - Cosine similarity is computed to find the similarity between courses.
  - Courses are sorted based on their similarity scores and the top 10 courses are returned.

- Collaborative Filtering (`collaborative_filtering_recommendations`):
  - This function recommends courses based on the ratings provided by similar users.
  - It creates a pivot table where users are rows, and courses are columns, with ratings as values.
  - Nearest Neighbors algorithm is used to find users similar to the current user.
  - Ratings from similar users are averaged to predict ratings for courses that the current user hasnâ€™t rated yet.
  - Recommendations are merged with course details and sorted to get the top 10 courses.

 3. Routes and Views

- Homepage (`/`):
  - Displays a form to input job role and user ID.
  - When the form is submitted, it processes the input:
    - If a user ID is provided, it performs both content-based and collaborative filtering.
    - If no user ID is provided, only content-based filtering is applied.
  - Recommendations are displayed on a new page (`recommendations.html`).

- Get Courses (`/get_courses/<job_role>`):
  - Provides a list of courses relevant to the specified job role in JSON format.

- Feedback (`/feedback`):
  - Allows users to submit feedback on courses, which includes a user ID, course ID, and rating.
  - The feedback is appended to the `ratings.csv` file.
  - The global `ratings_df` is reloaded to include the new feedback.

 4. Running the App

- The Flask application runs in debug mode, which provides detailed error messages and auto-reloads the server when code changes.

 Summary

- Content-Based Filtering relies on course features (skills) to recommend similar courses.
- Collaborative Filtering relies on user ratings and similarities between users to recommend courses.
- The application combines both methods to offer more comprehensive recommendations and allows users to provide feedback which refines the recommendations over time.
